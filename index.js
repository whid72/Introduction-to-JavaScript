This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the invocation (call) of the function so when it
returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

2. Also, pass to hungryDog an age value in years (note: if the dog is a puppy, the age will be a decimal. For example: three months = 3/12 or .25)

REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights

Feeding Requirements:

Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
   up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight
   6 - 10 lbs - 4% of their body weight 
   11 - 15 lbs - 3% of their body weight

Puppies less than 1 year
   2 - 4 months 10% of their body weight
   4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
   7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
